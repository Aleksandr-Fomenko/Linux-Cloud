<h3>"Marrakech": Word Histogram</h3>

Scenario: "Marrakech": Word Histogram

Level: Medium

Type: Do

Tags: bash  

Description: Find in the file frankestein.txt the second most frequent word and save in UPPER (capital) case in the /home/admin/mysolution file.

A word is a string of characters separated by space or newlines or punctuation symbols .,:; . Disregard case ('The', 'the' and 'THE' is the same word) and for simplification consider the apostrophe as another character not as punctuation ("it's" would be a word, distinct from "it" and "is"). Also disregard plurals ("car" and "cars" are different words) and other word variations (don't do "stemming").

We are providing a shorter test.txt file where the second most common word in upper case is "WORLD", so we could save this solution as: echo "WORLD" > /home/admin/mysolution

This problem can be done with a programming language (Python, Golang and sqlite3) or with common Linux utilities.

Test: echo "SOLUTION" | md5sum returns 19bf32b8725ec794d434280902d78e18

See /home/admin/agent/check.sh for the test that "Check My Solution" runs.

Time to Solve: 20 minutes.
